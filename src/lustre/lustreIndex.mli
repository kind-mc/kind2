(** Indexes for lists, records, tuples and arrays in Lustre

    In Lustre some indexes must be static at compile time, we can thus
    flatten all record, tuple and list values. The remaining indexes
    are array indexes, which we allow to be variable.

    Array indexes are annotated with an expression denoting the
    bound. However, this bound is not considered when comparing array
    indexes, because two bounds of expressions can only be evaluated
    in a context. A syntactic comparison of bound expressions will
    fail to make expressions equal that should be equal, for example
    in node calls where the size of an input is parametrized by
    another input.

    Lists in Lustre are similar to tuples, but they cannot be
    constructed, except as the inputs and outputs of node
    calls. Further, nested lists are to be flattened such that [((a,
    b), c)], [(a, (b, c))] and [(a, b, c)] are identical.
