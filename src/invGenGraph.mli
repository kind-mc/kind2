(* When calling invariant generation, remember to call [no_more_lsd]
   in your [on_exit] function, otherwise a running lsd instance
   would not be killed.


   Typical usage of external calls follows. The [ignore] set is to
   prune candidate invariants as early as possible.

   [ let system_candidates =
       mine_system
         synthesis mine_init mine_trans system
     in

     let rec loop ignore =

       (* Generate some terms to mine. *)
       let terms = generate_terms () in

       (* Then, either... *)
       if you_want then
         (* ...first mine candidates... *)
         let all_candidates =
           mine_terms
             (* Mined candidates are added to [system_candidates]. *)
             system terms system_candidates
         in

         Term.TermSet.cardinal all_candidates
         |> Event.log L_info "Got %i candidate terms."

         (* ...then run invariant generation. *)
         let invariants', ignore' =
           run system ignore maxK all_candidates
         in

         (* Bla. *)
         Term.TermSet.cardinal invariants'
         |> Event.log L_info "Found %i invariants."

         loop ignore'

       else
         (* ...or just run directly. *)
         let invariants', ignore' =
           mine_terms_run
             system ignore maxK terms system_candidates
         in

         (* Bla. *)

         |> Event.log L_info "Found %i invariants."

         loop ignore'
    in

    loop Term.TermSet.empty
  ]

  Note that you can accumulate candidate terms:

   [ let rec loop ignore candidates =
       (* Generate terms. *)
       let terms = generate_terms () in

       (* Mine them, adding to the candidate accumulator. *)
       let candidates' =
         mine_terms system terms candidates
       in

       (* Run invariant generation on all candidates. *)
       let invariants', ignore' =
         run system ignore maxK candidates'
       in

       (* Bla. *)
       Term.TermSet.cardinal invariants'
       |> Event.log L_info "Found %i invariants."

       loop ignore' candidates'
     in

     mine_system
       synthesis mine_init mine_trans system
     |> loop Term.TermSet.empty
   ]
