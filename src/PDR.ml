(* Recursively block counterexamples 

   [block s z c f] takes a pair of solver instances [s], the
   transition system [z], a stack of pairs of counterexamples and
   their frame [c] and the list of lower frames in descending order
   [f].

   The frames on the stack [c] are in ascending order such that
   reversing them and appending the frames [f] yields the frames in
   descending order. Each element on the stack is a pair of a
   generalized cube and a frame where this cube has to be blocked. In
   the solver instance [solver_frames] the clauses of each frame on
   the stack have been asserted on a new scope in the order they were
   pushed onto the stack.

   If there are no lower frames in [f], we are in frame R_1 and know
   the counterexample is not reachable from the initial state. We pop
   the counterexample and the frame from the stack, add the cube as
   blocking clause to its accompanying frame and pop one scope from
   the solver instance, thus removing the assertions of R_1.

   If we are in some frame R_i with i > 1 and have a counterexample
   cube B_i on the stack, we assert the clauses of R_i-1 on a new
   scope level of the solver instance and check if there is a
   counterexample to the unreachability of B_i.

   If B_i is reachable from R_i-1, we push the frame R_i-1 and the
   witness B_i-1 to the stack and recurse to block this new
   counterexample B_i-1.

   If B_i is not reachable from R_i-1, we pop the counterexample B_i
   and the frame R_i from the stack, add the cube as blocking clause
   to R_i and pop two scope levels from the solver instance to remove
   both the clauses in R_i-1 and R_i. We then recurse to block the
   remaining counterexamples on the stack.

   Frames are delta-encoded and in a list in descending order. The

   over the frames in reverse, i.e. ascending order, check for each
   clause C in R_i if R_i & T |= C' and move C to R_i+1 if the
   entailment holds. After all clauses of one frame have been
   processed, we pop one scope of the solver instance and continue
   with the clauses of the next frame. After all frames have been
   processed, a new frame is added and initialised with the clauses
   that could be propagated from the highest frame if any.

   If at some point all clauses of one frame could be propagated to
   the next, we have two equal frames, reached a fixpoint and can
   terminate having proved all properties.

(* PDR main loop

   [frames] is a list of clause sets in reverse order, the head of the
   list is the highest frame.

   Frames are delta-encoded, that is, every frame stores only the
   difference to the previous frame. The property is implicit in each
   frame and not stored there. The initial state is not a frame.

   Let [frames = \[ F_k; ... F_1 \], then let R_i be the union of all
   F_j with j <= i. Let R_0 be the initial state I.

   By construction two invariants of PDR are satisfied:

   (1) R_0 = I
   (2) R_i+1 is a subset of R_i for i = 1,...,k-1

   The procedure further maintains the invariants 

   (3) R_i |= P for i = 1,...,k
   (4) R_i & T |= R'_i+1 for i = 0,...,k

   and uses two SMT solver instances [solver_init] and [solver_frames].

   The instance [solver_init] is assumed to have the initial state
   constraint as well as the unprimed invariants asserted. The
   instance [solver_frames] is assumed to have the transition
   relation, the unprimed and primed invariants and the unprimed
   property asserted. The procedure restores the state of the solver
   instances to the state upon entry.

   A new frame is added to the head of [frames] and beginning with k=1
   all clauses are moved to the highest frame they can be propagated
   to, see {!fwd_propagate}. The last frame is strengthened by adding
   clauses to F_k and lower frames until the all successor states of
   R_k are within the property. If this fails, the exception
   [Counterexample] is raised, see {!strengthen}.
