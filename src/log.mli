(** A log is a tree of depth 4.

    The first level is the root and contains the top node as well as
    the kids at depth 2. They represent analyses of a specific
    system. In non modular analysis, depth 2 will only have one node,
    the top level. In modular analysis, then eventually depth 2 will
    have a node for all systems of the hierarchy.

    Nodes at depth 2 contain the system the analysis of which they
    correspond to, and kids at depth 3. These distinguish analyses with
    different subsystem, contract-based abstractions. They contain the
    list of the subsystems (of their depth 2 parent) which have been
    abstracted for the analysis they represent. When not running in
    compositional mode, a depth 2 node can only have one kid with an
    empty list of abstracted nodes.

    The kids of a depth 3 node store detail about property related
    events during the analysis their path corresponds to. They log
    information about invariant and falsified property, as well as
    k-true properties at the end of their analysis. *)
