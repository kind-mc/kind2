(* Parser for S-expressions
   
   Code lightly adapted from the OCaml sexplib, which is part of the
   ocaml-core alternative standard library for OCaml.

   Most of the sexplib in the ocaml-core library was written by:
   
   Markus Mottl          <markus.mottl@gmail.com>
   
   This work in turn is derived from the library "Tywith", version
   0.45.  The library "Tywith" was written and is distributed by:
   
   Martin Sandin         <msandin@hotmail.com>
