=========

Ocaml binding to the high-level C binding for ØMQ

Building
========

The commands

    ./autogen.sh
    ./build.sh

will build ZeroMQ, CZMQ and the OCaml binding. If you need to pass options to the configure script of any of ZeroMQ, CZMQ or ocamlczmq, add those to the `build.sh` call.

CZMQ and ZeroMQ are included
================

ZeroMQ and the CZMQ high-level C binding for ØMQ are included as subtrees from their respective github repositories. Nothing is needed to work with the sources, but in order to update ZeroMQ and CZMQ the git-subtree plugin is required. It is part of git, but not installed by default: get the git-subtree script and put it anywhere in the your path.

To pull a new release from the repositories do (adjust the tag to the new release)

    git subtree pull --prefix=zeromq --squash https://github.com/zeromq/zeromq3-x tags/v3.2.3
    git subtree pull --prefix=czmq --squash https://github.com/zeromq/czmq tags/v1.4.1

For the record, initially I did 

    git subtree add --prefix=zeromq --squash https://github.com/zeromq/zeromq3-x tags/v3.2.3
    git subtree add --prefix=czmq --squash https://github.com/zeromq/czmq tags/v1.4.1
